## COVID-19 Data Analysis - Business Questions

This section explores key business questions regarding COVID-19 data, focusing on the relationship between cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations.

1. How can we retrieve all available data for analyzing COVID-19 cases and deaths?
2. How can we view the specific metrics of total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population across different locations and dates?
3. What is the death percentage (total deaths vs. total cases) for each location, and how does it vary over time?
This helps to understand the severity of the pandemic across regions.
4. Which states or regions show higher death percentages in relation to total cases?
Helps identify locations that require greater medical attention or resources.
5. Which countries have death percentages higher than the global average (e.g., 2.92%)?
This allows a comparative analysis to find countries that have struggled more with fatality rates.
6. What are the countries with the highest death percentage relative to the number of cases?
Provides insights into the countries with the most severe outcomes from COVID-19.
7. What is the average death percentage per year for each country?
Tracking death rates over time is crucial to understanding the long-term impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of health measures.
8. How do total cases compare to the population size across different regions, and which locations have the highest cases relative to their population?
Useful for evaluating the scale of outbreaks compared to population size, which can inform regional responses.
9. Which continent has the highest total number of deaths?
Provides a continental-level perspective on the areas most affected by COVID-19.
10. Which specific countries or locations have the highest number of total deaths?
This helps to identify the most impacted countries and compare them with others globally.
11. What is the relationship between total population and vaccinations?
Understanding how vaccination efforts scale relative to the population size of each region helps in assessing vaccination coverage.
12. How can we analyze the progression of vaccinations alongside COVID-19 deaths for each location and date?
This information helps track vaccination rollouts and their possible impact on reducing COVID-19 deaths.
13. How can we calculate the cumulative number of new vaccinations for each location over time?
Monitoring cumulative vaccination data is essential for understanding trends and progress in immunization efforts.
